# vim: set ft=conf:
# INFO: https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customization.html

# These are my preferred default settings for Miller

# Input and output formats are CSV by default (unless otherwise specified
# on the mlr command line):
csv

# If a data line has fewer fields than the header line, instead of erroring
# (which is the default), just insert empty values for the missing ones:
allow-ragged-csv-input

# These are no-ops for CSV, but when I do use JSON output, I want these
# pretty-printing options to be used:
jvstack
jlistwrap

# Use "@", rather than "#", for comments within data files:
#skip-comments-with @
